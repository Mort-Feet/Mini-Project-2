Problem Statement

Predicting income levels based on demographic and socio-economic factors is a critical task for various applications, including targeted marketing, policy-making, and resource allocation. However, the challenge lies in accurately predicting whether an individual earns above a certain income threshold using available data.

Objective: 

The objective of this project was to predict whether an individual's income exceeds $50K per year based on census data. This was achieved by applying various supervised learning models, preceded by thorough data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis.

Steps and Methodology:

1. Data Preparation:

- Encoding Categorical Variables:

Categorical variables like workclass, marital status, occupation, etc., were encoded using Label Encoders to convert them into numerical form, suitable for machine learning models.

- Target Variable Creation:

The target variable income was converted into a binary outcome (0 for <=50K and 1 for >50K).

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

- Descriptive Statistics: 

Provided summary statistics of the dataset to understand the distribution and central tendencies of various features.

- Visualizations:

Created several plots, including a pie chart to visualize income distribution, histograms for age distribution, and a violin plot to explore the relationship between education and age.

- Correlation Matrix:

Generated a correlation matrix to identify relationships between features and how they correlate with the target outcome.

2. Supervised Learning Models:

- Train/Test Split: 

The data was split into training and test sets with stratification to maintain the distribution of the target variable across both sets.

- Model Selection: 

Applied multiple supervised learning models, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes, to predict income levels.

- Hyperparameter Tuning: 

Performed GridSearchCV to identify the best parameters for each model to optimize performance.

- Model Evaluation: 

Evaluated models using cross-validation accuracy, recall, precision, F1 score, and ROC AUC score. Confusion matrices were used to visualize the performance of each model.

4. Testing with New Variables:

- Random Selection:

Tested the model's predictions using randomly selected data points from the test set.

- Custom Inputs:

Provided completely new, hypothetical data to the model to evaluate its prediction capabilities.

Conclusion:
 
The project successfully applied and compared multiple machine learning models to predict income levels based on census data. The findings demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in handling binary classification problems, particularly in socio-economic data analysis.

Future Work:

1. Feature Engineering: 

Additional features, such as interaction terms or polynomial features, could be engineered to improve model performance.

2. Ensemble Methods:

Exploring more advanced ensemble techniques like XGBoost or stacking could further enhance predictive accuracy.

3. Real-World Application:

Implementing the model in a real-world application, such as targeting marketing campaigns or social services, could provide practical benefits.
